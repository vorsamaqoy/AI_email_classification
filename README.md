## 📧 Overview

An **intelligent email classification system** powered by AI that automates customer support email management. The system automatically analyzes incoming emails and determines:

- **Urgency Level**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Department Routing**: Technical, Billing, Sales, Support

Perfect for companies handling high volumes of customer support emails.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Dual-Model AI Classification**: Specialized models for urgency and department routing
- 🚀 **REST API**: Production-ready FastAPI implementation with authentication
- 📬 **Gmail Integration**: Direct integration with Gmail API for automated processing
- ⚡ **High Performance**: <150ms response time, 1000+ emails/hour batch processing
- 🔧 **Hot-Reload Config**: Update parameters without restarting the service
- 📊 **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance metrics and health checks
- 🔒 **Enterprise Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, API keys

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
Gmail API credentials (credentials.json)
4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
```

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd AI_customer_support

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure Gmail API
# - Download credentials.json from Google Cloud Console
# - Place it in the project root directory

# 4. Start the API server
python api.py
# Server running at: http://localhost:8000

# 5. Test Gmail classification
python gmail_classifier.py
```

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

```bash
# Health check and model status
GET  /health

# Classify single email
POST /classify
{
  "subject": "Server is down",
  "testo_email": "Production database crashed...",
  "sender": "ops@company.com"
}

# Batch classification
POST /classify/batch

# System statistics
GET  /stats

# Hot-reload configuration
POST /config/reload
```

### Example API Usage

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:8000/classify',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer demo_key_12345'},
    json={
        'subject': 'Database server not responding',
        'testo_email': 'Our main system appears to be down since this morning...',
        'sender': 'ops@company.com'
    }
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Urgency: {result['urgency']}")              # critical
print(f"Department: {result['department']}")        # technical
print(f"Confidence: {result['overall_confidence']}") # 0.94
```

## 🎯 Classification Examples

### Scenario 1: Technical Emergency
```
Input: "CRITICAL: Production database crashed"
Output:
├── Urgency: CRITICAL (95% confidence)
├── Department: TECHNICAL (98% confidence)
└── Action: Auto-escalation → DevOps Team
```

### Scenario 2: Sales Lead
```
Input: "Interested in a demo for 500 users"
Output:
├── Urgency: HIGH (87% confidence)
├── Department: SALES (92% confidence)
└── Action: Route → Sales Manager
```

### Scenario 3: Billing Issue
```
Input: "Invoice discrepancy - charged twice"
Output:
├── Urgency: HIGH (91% confidence)
├── Department: BILLING (95% confidence)
└── Action: Route → Finance Team
```

## 🤖 AI Technology

### Dual-Model Approach

The system uses **two specialized AI classifiers** working in parallel:

#### 1. Urgency Classifier
- Analyzes emotional tone and keywords
- Detects time-sensitive indicators
- Evaluates business impact
- Pattern: "emergency", "down", "asap", "critical"

#### 2. Department Classifier
- Technical content recognition
- Financial terminology detection
- Sales language patterns
- Sender domain analysis

### Cross-Validation Logic

```python
# Intelligent escalation rules
if department == 'technical' and urgency == 'high':
    critical_keywords = ['down', 'crashed', 'dead', 'failed']
    if any(keyword in content):
        urgency = 'critical'  # Auto-escalate
        confidence += 0.1
```

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Urgency Classification**: 89% accuracy
- **Department Routing**: 92% accuracy
- **Response Time**: <150ms per email
- **Throughput**: 1000+ emails/hour (batch mode)
- **Model Confidence**: Average 85%+

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Customize behavior via `config/classifier.yaml`:

```yaml
processing:
  confidence_threshold: 0.7
  batch_size: 50
  timeout_seconds: 30

models:
  urgency_model: "enterprise_v3.0"
  department_model: "custom_trained"
  enable_gpu: false

patterns:
  technical_keywords: ["api", "database", "server", "error"]
  critical_patterns: ["down", "crashed", "emergency"]
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

**Transparent Disclosure:**

This project was developed on **personal laptop hardware** with limited resources:

- Small pre-trained models (not fine-tuned on large datasets)
- CPU-only inference (no GPU acceleration)
- Limited training data for validation

**In an enterprise environment** with proper resources:
- Accuracy could exceed 95%
- Response time could drop to <50ms
- Support for advanced transformers (BERT, GPT)
- Continuous learning on company-specific data

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Transformer models integration (BERT/GPT)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Real-time learning from corrections
- [ ] CRM integrations (Salesforce, Zendesk, HubSpot)
- [ ] Slack/Teams notifications
- [ ] Mobile app for priority management
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
